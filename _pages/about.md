In the early 1980s, the monumental contributions of Charles Robert Darwin and Gregor Johann Mendel laid the foundation for modern biology, an influence still pervasive in current research. Charles's qualitative approach contrasted with Mendel's quantitative methodology, emphasizing natural wet lab settings and cultured dry lab environments, respectively, spanning population and molecular levels. Inspired by their legacy, I established the web page "bioLogY," breaking down the complete word "biology" into three parts.

The prefix "bio" signifies general biology, the middle part "log" represents the mathematical symbol for big data and logical integration. The term also conveys the idea that big data should be managed logically. The suffix "Y" carries a nuanced significance â€” in the XY sex-determination system, X is unknown and cannot define gender alone, whereas Y can. Thus, "Y" symbolizes something definitive and knowable in the context of science.

"bioLogY" conveys a message: the logical combination of intuitive wet lab insights and rational dry lab analyses allows for the study and understanding of biology questions. By translating qualitative "ATCG" into quantitative "1010" across space and time, the term underscores the human capacity to intelligently explore biology in a spatial-temporal framework.
